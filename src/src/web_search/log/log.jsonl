Ask them to perform web searches, open pages, and interact with content (e.g., clicking links, scrolling the viewport, etc., filling in form fields, etc.) It can also summarize the entire page, or answer questions based on the content of the page. It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\nfile_surfer: An agent that can handle local files.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS  \n   - The user wants to convert an image to manga style.  \n   - The user is interested in a specific ComfyUI workflow related to this task.  \n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP  \n   - The availability of a specific ComfyUI workflow for converting images to manga style.  \n   - The download path and process for the ComfyUI workflow.  \n   - Any documentation or resources regarding ComfyUI.  \n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE  \n   - The potential compatibility of the ComfyUI workflow with different image formats.  \n   - The technical requirements (like system compatibility) for using ComfyUI workflows.  \n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES  \n   - It is likely that there are community-developed workflows for ComfyUI that cater to image style conversion, including manga styles.  \n   - The download path for the ComfyUI workflow could involve a GitHub repository or a similar platform where such workflows are shared.  \n\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **WebSurfer**: \n  - Perform a search for ComfyUI workflows that specifically convert images to manga style.\n  - Identify and gather relevant resources, including any direct links to the specific workflow.\n  - Find download instructions or a repository for the ComfyUI workflow, ensuring it is accessible.\n  - Summarize the findings, including the path to download the workflow.\n\n- **file_surfer**: \n  - Await instructions on where to save the downloaded workflow once WebSurfer has provided the download link and instructions.  \n\n", "type": "OrchestrationEvent"}
